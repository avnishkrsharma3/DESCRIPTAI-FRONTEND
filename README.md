Business Impact:
        DescribeAI solves a $10 billion problem in e-commerce - content creation at scale. By using AI to generate SEO-optimized descriptions in bulk, we help businesses reduce content costs by 80% while improving search rankings and organic traffic. A typical customer can process 1000 products in 10 minutes instead of 200 hours.

Technical Innovation:
        I built a full-stack application with Angular and Spring Boot, integrating Google's Vertex AI for generative capabilities. The architecture uses PostgreSQL for transactional data and BigQuery for analytics, following microservices principles. I implemented prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are SEO-optimized with proper keyword density and semantic variations.

SEO Strategy:
        The AI doesn't just generate text - it creates search-engine-optimized content. Each description includes relevant keywords naturally, uses semantic variations to avoid stuffing, and maintains optimal length for search rankings. This helps products rank higher on Google, driving organic traffic without paid ads.
Scalability
        The system handles bulk operations asynchronously, allowing users to generate thousands of descriptions simultaneously. The dual-database approach separates operational and analytical workloads for better performance. With proper caching and lazy loading, the frontend remains responsive even with large datasets.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
